# olc rust sketches

Learning Rust with the olc Pixel Game Engine.

This project is based on [olcPixelGameEngine-rs](https://github.com/sadikovi/olcPixelGameEngine-rs), a Rust API by Ivan Sadikov for the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/) library by David Barr. See the [olcPixelGameEngine-rs](https://github.com/sadikovi/olcPixelGameEngine-rs) repo for docs and more.

## Examples

My own sketches and games are available in [examples/](./examples) directory.

## Run examples

The examples folder contains different sketches / demos. For example, run the Arrows demo with `cargo run --example arrows`.

## Run

Run `cargo run` to run the (empty) project at `./src/main.rs`.
